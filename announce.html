<p>The Allermetrix patient CLOUD reporting system has been upgraded to offer you greater search flexibility.  You may now search by date received, status and Allermetrix ID (AMX ID) in addition to the previous search modes of last name and client ID.  We have also added display filters for “specimen received”, “specimen in testing” and “completed results”.</p>
<p>Allermetrix is pleased to offer CLOUD based individualized diet plans that can be prepared online and printed in your office.  Each diet can be set up as a rotation and/or elimination plan for your patient.  Please contact us for training purposes on how to create and modify the diet.  As an alternative, we can prepare the diets for you based on your instructions.</p>
<p>NOTE: YOU MUST USE THE FIREFOX BROWSER FOR THE DIET TO WORK PROPERLY.  TO DOWNLOAD THE BROWSER (FREE) GO TO &#x2002;
