In-Memory driver

Getting started is very easy, please open the In-Memory Driver User's manual for details
on how to register the driver, and begin using it in your applications.

The driver manual is installed to: 

%INSTDIR%\docs\In-Memory-Driver\InMemoryDriverRef.pdf

and a shortcut is added to your Clarion program group under Start-->Programs-->Clarion-->Docs.
