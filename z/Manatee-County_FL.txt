In fact, all kinds of noise ordinances have cropped up in the past few years. In Boulder, CO, for example, it is now illegal to make any noise above \u003ca href=\"https://bouldercityreview.com/news/lets-not-get-loud-new-city-ordinance-limits-sound-levels-68215/\"\u003e70 decibels\u003c/a\u003e in a residential area.

Many areas have designated quiet hours or decibel noise limits. So if your city's quiet hours run from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., keep a log of every time your neighbor is practicing tuba inside of those hours.

Then again, it is OK for a tenant to deny entry to their landlord if they show up unannounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the landlord intends to rent or sell the property to someone new, they may ask you to allow additional showings, Zuetel says.
