racket. The deafening music, the raised voices, unrelenting hammering, or other distracting noises can become a nightmare, especially in a building where you're in close proximity—or even sharing walls—with your neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you own your home, you’re going to have to figure out how to handle the noise pollution yourself—but what if you rent?

In fact, all kinds of noise ordinances have cropped up in the past few years. In Boulder, CO, for example, it is now illegal to make any noise above \u003ca href=\"https://bouldercityreview.com/news/lets-not-get-loud-new-city-ordinance-limits-sound-levels-68215/\"\u003e70 decibels\u003c/a\u003e in a residential area. In communities across California, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Arizona, regulations against excessive leaf blower noise have been instituted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while some of these rules may seem extreme, studies show that noise pollution does more than just bug people; it also affects their mental health. (\u003ca href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1409400\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOne study\u003c/a\u003e found that people in noisy neighborhoods were 25% more likely to be depressed.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow, we broach this touchy subject and provide clarity for renters who find themselves in this situation. Here's how to deal with noisy neighbors and what to do if the problem isn't being resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"landlord-or-renter-it-depends\"\u003eLandlord or renter? It depends!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaws vary by state, and different types of residences also have to be taken into consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The situation changes depending on whether you’re talking about a duplex or multifamily property, or a single-family rental home,” says \u003cstrong\u003eJacob Naig\u003c/strong\u003e, owner of We Buy Houses in Des Moines, IA. “In a single-family home, if the neighbor is having late-night parties or causing a general noise disturbance, the occupier should address the situation with the neighbor politely and then place a call to the police if they don’t comply.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if it’s a large apartment or anywhere that an interior wall is shared, the dynamics change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would still suggest trying to talk to the neighbor first, and see if you can resolve the situation,\" says Naig. \"If it doesn’t work, the landlord will have to step in. Vacancy costs every landlord, and they’ll do what they can so they don’t have to turn over the units.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter where you live, you should read the fine print of your lease agreement, and add any clauses regarding noise that you foresee being relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In Missouri, for example, the landlord-tenant law does not specify that the landlord has to deal with a noisy tenant,” says \u003cstrong\u003eBob Scott\u003c/strong\u003e, founder of Sell Land, based in Missouri. “But if you specify beforehand in the lease agreement that your landlord should deal with noisy neighbors, then they will be legally obligated to enforce this provision if they signed the agreement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-do-if-the-ruckus-wont-stop\"\u003eWhat to do if the ruckus won't stop\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a renter, if you find yourself in an unmanageable situation with a noisy neighbor, there are several ways to address the problem, without requiring a change of address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tenants who live in a rental house have the right to quiet,” says \u003cstrong\u003eBen Fisher\u003c/strong\u003e, a luxury real estate specialist at the Fisher Group in Park City, UT. “Landlords are ultimately responsible for resolving inconveniences created by loud neighbors.\" So your first step should be to contact the landlord and report the excessive noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also look up your city's laws about noise. Many areas have designated quiet hours or decibel noise limits. So if your city's quiet hours run from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., keep a log of every time your neighbor is practicing tuba inside of those hours. You can present this log as further proof that your neighbor is breaking the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf going to your landlord proves futile and the ruckus won't stop, the next step is to contact the police. This strategy will be most effective when the noise is actually happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately though, you may just have to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are free to leave your rental without any further responsibility in such a case if you have provided a proper amount of notice,” Fisher says.\u003c/p\u003e\n","modified":"2022-08-22T22:07:43+00:00","published":"2022-08-21T21:30:13+00:00","slug":"landlord-or-renter-who-has-to-handle-noisy-neighbors","author":{"ID":827,"name":"Kathleen Willcox","slug":"kwillcox","display_name":"Kathleen Willcox","description":"Kathleen Willcox is a journalist who covers real estate, travel, and food and wine.

They'll be eager to find new renters, but the law states they can't just unlock your door at any time and pop in for a visit. They also aren't allowed to show the apartment so many times that it creates a nuisance for you and disrupts your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're a renter, read on for the rules of landlord entry, so you know what to expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"landlord-notice-of-entry\"\u003eLandlord notice of entry\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLandlords are legally obligated to provide a renter with notice that they'll be entering the premises—for \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e reason. Whether that's to show the property to a potential renter or to fix a leaky faucet, the law is clear: Legal tenants have the right to quiet enjoyment of their home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The landlord must provide reasonable notice in writing (generally, 24 hours) of his intent to enter—and to do it only during normal business hours,\" explains \u003cstrong\u003eBryan Zuetel\u003c/strong\u003e, a Realtor® and real estate attorney from Irvine, CA. If a tenant is home and consents to entry, the 24-hour notice can be waived. Then again, it is OK for a tenant to deny entry to their landlord if they show up unannounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the landlord intends to rent or sell the property to someone new, they may ask you to allow additional showings, Zuetel says. And depending on what's spelled out in your lease agreement, you may have to comply. \"For example, under certain conditions, a landlord may require that the tenant permit a weekend open house during regular business hours, and the landlord may provide oral notice of entry to the tenant,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo pull out the paperwork you signed if you're worried that your landlord is crossing the line. Landlords who are following those guidelines are probably in the clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-often-can-a-landlord-show-an-apartment\"\u003eHow often can a landlord show an apartment?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRental law does not specifically stipulate a maximum number of times a landlord is allowed to show an apartment to prospective tenants. It does, however, provide some cover for tenants. \"The landlord may not abuse the right of access, or use it to harass the tenant,\" Zuetel explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat might sound vague, but if you do feel like your landlord is abusing the right of access and bothering you too often, you should try talking to them first, before calling an attorney. \"Let them know that you are feeling stressed from all the showings and ask for a break for a few days—that seems more than reasonable,\" says \u003cstrong\u003eHolly Pasut\u003c/strong\u003e, a Realtor with Hines and Associates Realty in Cornelius, NC.
